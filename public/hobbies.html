    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What I do in my free time:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I love to read both novels and manga (Japanese comics.)</li>
          <li>
            My favorite genres are:
            <ul>
              <li>Horror</li>
              <li>Slice of Life</li>
              <li>Psychological/ Thriller</li>
              <li>Romance</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Creating</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>My favorite things are drawing and creative writing.</li>
          <li>
            Even though I'm not the best at either, I still love to craft stories and create
            characters.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Eating good food is something that I don't think I could live without.</li>
          <li>
            Testing new recipes is something I do almost every week, I think I would get bored if I
            ate the same things all of the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Baking is another aspect of cooking I do a lot, particularly cakes, cookies, breads, and
            pies.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Camping</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>My favorite place to go camping is the Adirondack Mountains.</li>
          <li>While camping, I love to go hiking, biking, and canoeing.</li>
          <li>
            My dream is to be able to take a road trip around the United States and camp in as many
            places as I can.
